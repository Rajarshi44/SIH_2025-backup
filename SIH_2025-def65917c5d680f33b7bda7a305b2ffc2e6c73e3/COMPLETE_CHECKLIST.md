---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Backend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

✅ Server at: http://localhost:3000

### Step 2: Update ESP32 IP

Edit `sih.ino` line 16:

```cpp
const char* ws_host = "YOUR_COMPUTER_IP";  // e.g., "192.168.1.100"
```

### Step 3: Upload & Test

1. Arduino IDE → Upload to ESP32
2. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
3. Wait for "[WS] ✅ Connected to server!"

## 📱 Dashboard Access

**URL:** http://localhost:3000/dashboard

**Login:**

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**What You'll See:**

- ✅ Real-time telemetry (voltage, current, RPM)
- ✅ Motor control toggles and sliders
- ✅ Live charts updating every second
- ✅ Jam detection warnings
- ✅ Connection status indicators

---

## 🔌 Hardware Connections (Unchanged from Blynk)

### ESP32 Pins

```
Motor A Control:
  GPIO 25 → ENA (PWM)
  GPIO 26 → IN1
  GPIO 27 → IN2

Motor B Control:
  GPIO 33 → ENB (PWM)
  GPIO 32 → IN3
  GPIO 35 → IN4

I2C Bus:
  GPIO 21 → SDA
  GPIO 22 → SCL

INA219 Sensors:
  0x40 → Motor A current/voltage
  0x41 → Motor B current/voltage
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Backend Server

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Shows: `[WebSocket] Server initialized on /ws`
- [ ] Port 3000 is accessible
- [ ] Dashboard loads at http://localhost:3000

### ESP32 Connection

- [ ] WiFi connects (check SSID/password)
- [ ] I2C scanner finds 0x40 and 0x41
- [ ] WebSocket connects to server
- [ ] Serial shows: `[WS] ✅ Connected`

### Dashboard Functionality

- [ ] Login successful
- [ ] Green WiFi indicator visible
- [ ] Motor cards show telemetry data
- [ ] Toggle switches work
- [ ] Speed sliders work
- [ ] Charts update in real-time

### Motor Control

- [ ] Click toggle → motor starts
- [ ] Serial shows: `📥 Command: START`
- [ ] Motor physically runs
- [ ] Adjust slider → speed changes
- [ ] Click toggle off → motor stops

### Telemetry Flow

- [ ] ESP32 sends data every 500ms
- [ ] Dashboard receives updates
- [ ] Voltage/current display updates
- [ ] RPM changes when motor speed changes
- [ ] Charts scroll with new data

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "WebSocket not connecting"

**Check:**

- [ ] Backend server is running
- [ ] ESP32 has correct server IP
- [ ] Both on same WiFi network
- [ ] Firewall not blocking port 3000
- [ ] Device token matches (esp32-device-token-xyz)

### "Dashboard not updating"

**Check:**

- [ ] Logged in with valid credentials
- [ ] Green WiFi icon in dashboard
- [ ] Browser console for WebSocket errors
- [ ] JWT token valid (login again)

### "Motors not responding"

**Check:**

- [ ] ESP32 receiving commands (Serial Monitor)
- [ ] L298N power supply connected
- [ ] Motor driver wiring correct
- [ ] PWM pins working (check with LED test)

### "No current/voltage readings"

**Check:**

- [ ] INA219 sensors powered (3.3V)
- [ ] I2C wiring (SDA=21, SCL=22)
- [ ] I2C scanner finds 0x40 and 0x41
- [ ] INA219 VIN+/VIN- connected to motor power
